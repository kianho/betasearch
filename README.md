# BetaSearch

**UPDATE**: We are currently in the process of refactoring BetaSearch. You may contact me via email
(see `setup.py`) and I will assist you with your queries.  Alternatively, you
can refer to the original betasearch website
([http://betasearch.kianho.net](http://betasearch.kianho.net)) whilst this
repository is being updated. Thank you for your patience.
